The mpgraphics package
v0.3

mpgraphics allows users to typeset metapost inline and display
figures in their LaTeX documents with only and only one run of
LaTeX, or PDFLaTeX, or XelaTeX (no separate runs of mpost).
mpgraphics achieves this by using shell scape or write 18
feature so the whole process is automatic and the
end user do not need to carry out the long process.

If you want to report any bugs or typos and corrections in the documentation,
or ask for any new features, or suggest any improvements, or ask any questions
about the package, then please do not send any direct emails to us; we will not
answer any direct emails. Instead please use the issue tracker:
  <https://github.com/persian-tex/mpgraphics/issues>
In doing so, please always explain your issue well enough, always include
a minimal working examples showing the issue, and always choose the appropriate
label for your query (i.e. if you are reporting any bugs, choose `bug' label).

Current version release date: 2013/04/04
